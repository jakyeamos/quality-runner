# Agent Usage

Quality Runner gives agents evidence and a handoff. The agent still owns the
work plan. For large or repo-wide remediation, agents should convert the QR
handoff into GSD-style phases and execute one coherent batch at a time.

## Start With QR

Run QR before editing:

```bash
quality-runner refresh /path/to/repo \
  --run-id-prefix qr-<date-or-task> \
  --handoff-output /tmp/qr-handoff.md \
  --json
```

Then read:

- `/tmp/qr-handoff.md`
- `.quality-runner/runs/<run-id>/quality-audit.json`
- `.quality-runner/runs/<run-id>/remediation-plan.json`
- `.quality-runner/runs/<run-id>/gate-verification.json`, when present
- `.quality-runner/runs/<run-id>/code-quality-scan.json`, when structural
  findings drive the work

Do not edit source before reading the handoff and the relevant artifacts.

## Required Agent Protocol

Before changing code, write or update planning artifacts in the target repo.
Use the repo's existing planning location when one exists. Otherwise use:

```text
.planning/
  STATE.md
  phases/
    <phase-number>-<slug>/
      PLAN.md
      RESOLUTION-LEDGER.tsv
      <batch-number>-SUMMARY.md
```

Do not treat this as QR-owned output. These files are agent planning artifacts.
QR may reference them later, but QR does not execute them.

## GSD-Style Phase Plan Template

Each phase `PLAN.md` should use this shape:

```md
# Phase <number>: <name>

## Goal

One or two sentences describing the bounded outcome.

## QR Evidence

- QR run id:
- Handoff:
- Primary status/classification:
- Blocker classes:
- Finding groups or ledger rows addressed:

## Scope

- In scope:
- Out of scope:
- Expected files/modules touched:

## Batches

| Batch | Cluster | Evidence source | Expected edits | Verification | Stop condition | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  | pending |

## Execution Rules

- Work one coherent cluster at a time.
- Prefer current scanner or gate evidence over stale line numbers.
- Preserve pre-existing dirty work.
- Do not commit `.quality-runner/` artifacts unless already tracked.
- Do not mix unrelated finding families in one batch.
- If a batch exposes a real correctness bug, fix it only when it is local to
  the same cluster; otherwise record it as the next batch or a blocker.

## Verification Ladder

- Focused checks:
- Scanner or QR proof:
- Repo/package gates:
- Final rerun:

## Completion Criteria

- QR status target:
- Ledger target:
- Remaining accepted blockers:
```

## Batch Loop

For each batch:

1. Select the next cluster from current QR evidence, scanner output, or the
   phase ledger. Prefer high-yield clusters with shared cause, file ownership,
   or verification.
2. Read the affected files before editing.
3. State the intended edit pattern and why it preserves behavior.
4. Make the smallest coherent code change.
5. Run focused verification first.
6. Run scanner or QR proof for the exact finding family.
7. Update the phase ledger only for findings proven fixed, accepted, stale,
   superseded, or blocked with evidence.
8. Add or update a batch summary with commands and results.
9. Commit the coherent batch when source files changed and verification passed.
10. Push when the branch is expected to be shared or the run is long-lived.

## Batch Summary Template

```md
# Batch <number>: <name>

## Scope

- Files changed:
- QR findings or ledger rows addressed:
- Related blockers:

## Changes

- TBD

## Verification

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
|  |  |

## QR / Scanner Result

- Previous count:
- Current count:
- Rows fixed:
- Rows left unresolved:

## Blockers

- TBD

## Commit

- Commit:
- Push status:
```

## Ordering Rules

Use this default order unless the user gives a different priority:

1. Dependency setup, environment, and read-only policy blockers.
2. Failing executable gates.
3. Missing repo-owned gates.
4. High-signal correctness, safety, and type hardening findings.
5. High-yield structural clusters by file or rule family.
6. Broad cleanup and style-only work.

## Final Report

When stopping, report:

- QR run ids compared
- Final QR status and classification
- Handoff path
- Phase and batch artifacts updated
- Files changed
- Verification commands and results
- Commit hashes and push status
- Remaining blockers or next recommended phase
